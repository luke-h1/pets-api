## Getting Started

**You will need to install the following in order to get this project up & running locally**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

**use correct package manager and npm versions**

Corepack is a tool installed as part of your Node.js installation that allows you to install and
manage multiple package manager versions in your environment based on per-project configuration
(via the `packageManager` field in `package.json`).

We use corepack to ensure that everyone is using the same version of PNPM to avoid any issues when
people are using different versions of PNPM.

```bash
corepack enable
nvm install
nvm use
```

If for some reason the above corepack command doesn't work, you can install PNPM manually by running:

```bash
PNPM_VERSION=$(node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').engines.pnpm)")
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | env PNPM_VERSION=$PNPM_VERSION sh -
```

This will install the package manager version specified in the `package.json` file. You can check
that this has been installed by running:

```bash
pnpm -v
```

### Install dependencies

Install the project's PNPM dependencies by simply running:

```sh
pnpm i
```

### Running the server

cd into the api directory for the following commands

```sh
cd apps/api
```

### setup databases

```
docker-compose up
```

you will then need to generate the prisma client and run migrations to create the tables in your database

```sh
pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate
```

### start the server

```sh
pnpm dev
```

You can validate that the server is running by visiting `http://localhost:8000/api/healthcheck` in your browser. If everything is setup ok, you should see a response with the following body:

```
{
  db: true,
  cache: true,
  status: "OK"
}
```

### Documentation

Documentation of all endpoints can be found by visiting `http://localhost:8000/docs`. We use `zod-to-openapi` to transform the validation schemas that the server uses into openAPI specs for swagger to present

### Running integration tests

```sh
pnpm t
```

This will setup the test database, run the integration & unit tests, and then finally reset the test database.

### Running end-to-end tests

First you'll need to install playwright browsers if you haven't already

```sh
make e2e-install-browsers
```

Run all tests

```sh
make e2e-local
```

Run one test

```sh
make e2e-local <name of test>
```
